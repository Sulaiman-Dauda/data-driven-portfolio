# Data Driven Portfolio
👋 Hi there! I'm Sulaiman, a seasoned Data Analyst with a passion for leveraging technology to drive impactful insights. Currently based remotely at Bluechip Technologies Limited, I specialize in data wrangling and analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy), R and SQL, coupled with advanced visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.

🌐 My professional journey spans across diverse sectors including healthcare and banking, where I've applied machine learning algorithms (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow) to enhance operations and decision-making. My academic background includes a Distinction in M.Sc. Applied Data Science from the University of Essex, focusing on predictive analytics and machine learning interpretability.

🎮 When I'm not crunching numbers or coding, you can find me on the football field or strategizing in analytical video games.!

This portfolio showcases my skills with collection of projects where I've applied data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, data visualization, presentation skills, etc to derive insights and solve real-world problems. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in various technologies and tools such as R, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and more.
