# Housing Price Prediction Model

_**Goal**_: To develop a robust machine learning model that predicts housing prices based on various features.

_**Description**_: This project analyzes a housing dataset from Kaggle to predict housing prices using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key correlations and insights. By employing the RandomForestRegressor algorithm, known for its robustness in capturing complex relationships, ResiPrice aims to deliver a reliable model for estimating housing prices. This initiative not only enhances decision-making capabilities for real estate professionals and homeowners but also empowers prospective buyers with informed insights into property market dynamics.

_**Skills**_: Data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, Python programming.

_**Technology**_: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib.

_**Results**_: Developed a RandomForestRegressor model with an R-squared of 0.7424, indicating 74.24% variance explained in housing prices. Identified key predictors such as area, bathrooms, and parking.
