# Analysis of Alzheimer’s Dataset

_**Goal**_: To investigate factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

_**Description**_: This project analyzes a dataset of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, employing R for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, logistic regression, and feature selection. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including converting categorical variables and handling missing data. Descriptive statistics provided insights into variable distributions. EDA utilized boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots to visualize data characteristics. Clustering algorithms, specifically k-means, identified distinct clusters based on brain volume characteristics. Logistic regression was employed to predict Alzheimer’s diagnosis, evaluating model performance with accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Feature selection techniques identified significant predictors influencing disease classification.

_**Skills**_: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering algorithms, logistic regression, feature selection, statistical modeling, R programming.

_**Technology**_: R, ggplot2, caret, brglm, pROC.

_**Results**_: The analysis revealed that variables such as education level (EDUC) and clinical dementia rating (CDR) significantly impact Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The logistic regression model achieved perfect accuracy and AUC on the testing set. Feature selection identified EDUC, CDR, eTIV, and nWBV as key predictors for disease classification.
