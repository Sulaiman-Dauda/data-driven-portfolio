# Data Driven Portfolio
üëã Hi there! I'm Sulaiman, a seasoned Data Analyst with a passion for leveraging technology to drive impactful insights. Currently based remotely at Bluechip Technologies Limited, I specialize in data wrangling and analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy), R and SQL, coupled with advanced visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.

üåê My professional journey spans across diverse sectors including healthcare and banking, where I've applied machine learning algorithms (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow) to enhance operations and decision-making. My academic background includes a Distinction in M.Sc. Applied Data Science from the University of Essex, focusing on predictive analytics and machine learning interpretability.

üéÆ When I'm not crunching numbers or coding, you can find me on the football field or strategizing in analytical video games.!

This portfolio showcases my skills with collection of projects where I've applied data wrangling, data exploration, statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, data visualization, presentation skills, etc to derive insights and solve real-world problems. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in various technologies and tools such as R, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and more.

## Project 1 - Analyzing Police Use of Force Incidents in Dallas, Texas (2016)
_**Goal**_:- To analyze and visualize data on police use of force incidents in Dallas, Texas, to identify patterns and potential biases.

_**Description**_:- This project dives into a dataset from Dallas Police Department documenting incidents of police use of force in 2016. The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution of incidents by race, gender, days of the week, months, types of force used, and geographical locations. Advanced data visualization techniques such as bar plots, stacked bar plots, and geographical mapping were employed to visualize insights effectively.

_**Skills**_:- Data analysis, data visualization, statistical analysis, geographical mapping, data manipulation.

_**Technology**_:- R, ggplot2, Leaflet for R.

_**Results**_:- The analysis uncovered disparities in incidents involving different racial and gender groups, highlighted peak incident days and months, and identified predominant types of force used by officers. Insights gleaned from this project underscore the importance of addressing potential biases in policing practices and advocating for data-driven reforms.

## Project 2 - Exploring Biodiversity Trends Using Proportional Species Richness Data

_**Goal**_:- To analyze trends in biodiversity using proportional species richness data across different taxonomic groups and geographical locations.

_**Description**_:- This project explores a dataset comprising seven variables representing proportional species richness in Dallas, Texas. The variables include Bird, Carabids, Hoverflies, Isopods, Macromoths, Grasshoppers & Crickets, and Vascular plants. The analysis involves univariate analysis to examine mean, standard deviation, and skewness for each variable. A correlation matrix is also constructed to assess relationships between these variables. Hypothesis testing using one-sample t-tests and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests is conducted to analyze biodiversity changes and distribution differences between taxonomic groups. Simple linear regression is used to explore relationships between biodiversity in different periods (Y70 and Y00), while multiple linear regression assesses the impact of ecological variables on biodiversity.

_**Skills**_:- Data exploration, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, linear regression, multivariate analysis.

_**Technology**_:- R, ggplot2, stats package.

_**Results**_:- The analysis reveals significant correlations between certain taxonomic groups, with Bird and Macromoths showing the strongest positive correlation (0.83). Biodiversity trends indicate varied changes across taxonomic groups between 1970 and 2000, with notable increases observed in Vascular plants and Isopods. Regression analyses highlight predictors of biodiversity change, with ecological variables like Carabids and Vascular plants significantly influencing biodiversity metrics.

## Project 3 - Analyzing TED Talks by Omar Ahmad and Jack Conte

_**Goal**_: To analyze TED Talks delivered by Omar Ahmad and Jack Conte, focusing on identifying their most frequently used words, comparing vocabularies, and assessing the sentiments expressed.

_**Description**_: This project involves analyzing TED Talks by Omar Ahmad and Jack Conte using R and packages like tidyverse, tidytext, and dplyr. The analysis begins with loading and preprocessing the TED Talks dataset, tokenizing words, and removing stop words. It computes word frequencies for each speaker and compares their most common words. Visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots are created using ggplot2 to visualize word frequencies and relationships between speakers.

_**Skills**_: Text mining, sentiment analysis, data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), R programming.

_**Technology**_: R, ggplot2, tidyverse, tidytext, dplyr.

_**Results**_: The analysis reveals distinct word usage patterns between Omar Ahmad and Jack Conte. Both speakers use common words like "going" and "time," but Omar Ahmad emphasizes "letter," while Jack Conte discusses "dollars." Sentiment analysis indicates predominantly neutral and positive expressions in both speeches, underscoring their optimistic tones.

## Project 4 - Analysis of Alzheimer‚Äôs Dataset

_**Goal**_: To investigate factors associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques.

_**Description**_: This project analyzes a dataset of individuals with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, employing R for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, logistic regression, and feature selection. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including converting categorical variables and handling missing data. Descriptive statistics provided insights into variable distributions. EDA utilized boxplots, histograms, and scatterplots to visualize data characteristics. Clustering algorithms, specifically k-means, identified distinct clusters based on brain volume characteristics. Logistic regression was employed to predict Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis, evaluating model performance with accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Feature selection techniques identified significant predictors influencing disease classification.

_**Skills**_: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering algorithms, logistic regression, feature selection, statistical modeling, R programming.

_**Technology**_: R, ggplot2, caret, brglm, pROC.

_**Results**_: The analysis revealed that variables such as education level (EDUC) and clinical dementia rating (CDR) significantly impact Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis. The logistic regression model achieved perfect accuracy and AUC on the testing set. Feature selection identified EDUC, CDR, eTIV, and nWBV as key predictors for disease classification.
