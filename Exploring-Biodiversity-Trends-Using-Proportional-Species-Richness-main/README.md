# Exploring Biodiversity Trends Using Proportional Species Richness

_**Goal**_:- To analyze trends in biodiversity using proportional species richness data across different taxonomic groups and geographical locations.

_**Description**_:- This project explores a dataset comprising seven variables representing proportional species richness in Dallas, Texas. The variables include Bird, Carabids, Hoverflies, Isopods, Macromoths, Grasshoppers & Crickets, and Vascular plants. The analysis involves univariate analysis to examine mean, standard deviation, and skewness for each variable. A correlation matrix is also constructed to assess relationships between these variables. Hypothesis testing using one-sample t-tests and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests is conducted to analyze biodiversity changes and distribution differences between taxonomic groups. Simple linear regression is used to explore relationships between biodiversity in different periods (Y70 and Y00), while multiple linear regression assesses the impact of ecological variables on biodiversity.

_**Skills**_:- Data exploration, statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, linear regression, multivariate analysis.

_**Technology**_:- R, ggplot2, stats package.

_**Results**_:- The analysis reveals significant correlations between certain taxonomic groups, with Bird and Macromoths showing the strongest positive correlation (0.83). Biodiversity trends indicate varied changes across taxonomic groups between 1970 and 2000, with notable increases observed in Vascular plants and Isopods. Regression analyses highlight predictors of biodiversity change, with ecological variables like Carabids and Vascular plants significantly influencing biodiversity metrics.
